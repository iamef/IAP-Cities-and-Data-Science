    "### 1. Anaconda Distribution\n",
    "The open-source Anaconda Distribution is the easiest way to perform Python/R data science and machine learning on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 1: Use the this link https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/ to download the __Python 3 version__ of Anaconda.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 2: After successfully downloaded Anaconda Distribution. Run Anaconda Navigator, then you will see a main menu of the Navigator with 4 items:\n",
    "    - __Home__: This window shows all current coding environment / application,  such as Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, Spyder, RStudio, and among others. If the application is pre-installed, you can directly launch it by clicking \"Launch\" button. Otherwise, you will need to Install first before launching. You can also choose which version of the application to install by clicking the small gear icon on the upper-right corner of each application.   \n",
    "    - __Environments__: This window shows all current settings of your Python environemnt. We will explain more in Step 3. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - __Learning__: Anaconda Navigator provides rich learning resources including library documentations, tutorials, and technical reference. You can learn more in-depth specifications  here.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - __Community__: Python community is huge and diverse. Here you can find various forums, online interest groups, and blogs to communicate and engage with others.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 3: Go to __Environment__, this window provides a list of all installed libraries and their current version. This is your central place to install new libraries or upgrade installed ones to a newer version.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 4: Go to __Home__, launch [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org), a web-based interactive computing notebook environment. A new window should pop up on your browser showing your [home directry](http://www.linfo.org/home_directory.html). You now can 1) navigate through your file directories; 2) create new folder, add, delete, or rename files; 3) create new Jupyter Notebooks.\n",

    "Through the workshop, we will introduce multiple most commonly used Python Packages for applied data science practice. You can find a comprehensive Python Package Index here: https://pypi.org\n",

    "### 2. Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) (Python Data Analysis Library) is a open source package widely used for [data munding and wrangling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling). Some major functions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reading and writing data in vaious formats;\n",
    "- Data manupulation including reshaping, pivoting, slicing, indexing, and subsetting large datasets.\n",
    "- Data merging and joining;\n",
    "- Data cleaning, such as hanlding missing value or replacing value;\n",
    "- Basic analysis tools for descriptive summary and time-series analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is popular in a wide variety of academic and commercial domains, including Finance, Neuroscience, Economics, Statistics, Advertising, Web Analytics, and more. This tutorial guides you some basic Pandas techniques. Below is a 10 minutes [quick overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_T8LGqJtuGc&feature=emb_title) of Pandas by the creator Wes McKinney."
